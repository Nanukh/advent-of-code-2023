My scripts for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge!


**DISCLAIMER:** I don't code that much in "raw" TypeScript, so code quality is likely going to be iffy at best...<br>
Besides, I'm not trying to build an [Enterprise Edition‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) üòù

## Installation

1) Download your puzzle inputs (`https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/<day>`)
2) Add them to `src/assets` following the naming convention: `<day>-input.txt`
<br>Examples: `02-input.txt`, `14-input.txt`, etc
3) Run `npm install`, then `npm run start`
